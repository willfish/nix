# Configure Claude Code MCP servers (user scope)
# Re-run this after installing Claude Code on a new machine.
#
# NOTE: The official Slack MCP server (https://mcp.slack.com/mcp) does not
# support dynamic client registration, which Claude Code requires for OAuth.
# This works in the Claude browser app (pre-registered client) but not in
# the CLI. Waiting on upstream support:
# https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21107
#
# For now, Slack and Gmail integrations are only available via Claude's
# browser app with first-party connectors.
